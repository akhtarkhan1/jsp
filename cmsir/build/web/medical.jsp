The records of PME done/due date are updated along with correction of vision
recommended in the medical certificate after crew passes the PME. Crews failing to pass
PME are not allowed to work on Running Duty<br></br>

The CMS should be able to produce a Monthly report of staff due for medical examination.
When a staff is sent for Medical examination he is considered to be on duty for the first 3
days and absent thereafter. This absent period can be later regularized as leave. No staff
due for PME can be booked for running a train.</br><br>

The medical records of the running staff are maintained at the base station. On his transfer
his records are transferred to the other station.
