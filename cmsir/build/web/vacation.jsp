For the first time, the Railways has extended the facility of AC-3 tier travel pass for the family of the lowest
grade employees of the Indian Railways like the gangmen, khalashis, etc. Employees of Group D in the railways were
earlier not entitled for travel pass in AC compartments. Revised entitlement of travel on railway passes has also
been extended to all Junior Engineers and their supervisors working in the grade pay of Rs 4200, and they have been
provided entitlements to travel in AC 2 tier coaches.
